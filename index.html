            <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹, thanks for checking out my website!</p>
            <p>As you might be able to tell from the title, my name is Azia Bay-Asen. I am a junior-year computer science major and creative writing minor at the <a class="underline-on-hover" href="https://www.utdallas.edu/" target="_blank">University of Texas at Dallas</a>. I was born on the tropical island Guam, where I spent the first eighteen years of my life, before I moved to Richardson, Texas in the pursuit of higher education and greater opportunity. I have a variety of interests and experience in full-stack desktop, mobile, and website software development; and secondary and higher education.</p>
            <p>What am I doing right now, you may be wondering?</p>
            <p>Right now, I am working toward graduating with honors as a member of the <a class="underline-on-hover" href="https://honors.utdallas.edu/national-merit-scholars-program/" target="_blank">National Merit Scholars Program</a> and the <a class="underline-on-hover" href="https://honors.utdallas.edu/" target="_blank">Hobson Wildenthal Honors College</a>, or Collegium V, at my university; I am performing leadership and administrative duties as an Education Officer and Technical Interview Preparation Lead with the <a class="underline-on-hover" href="https://acmutd.co/" target="_blank">Association for Computing Machinery</a>, Education division; I am completing the research project, "AeroVista: Leveraging Computer Vision to Create High-Performance Search-and-Rescue Drones" alongside my research team at the Association for Computing Machinery, Research division; I am preparing for my upcoming summer study abroad at the <a class="underline-on-hover" href="https://isiflorence.org/" target="_blank">International Studies Institute</a> in Florence, Italy; and I am also preparing for my upcoming flight software engineering internship with the aerospace engineering unicorn start-up, <a class="underline-on-hover" href="https://www.yorkspacesystems.com/" target="_blank">York Space Systems</a> in Denver, Colorado.</p>
            <p>Suffice to say, I like keeping myself busy.</p>
